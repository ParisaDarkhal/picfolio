# PicFolio

PicFolio is a web application built with React and styled using Material-UI (MUI). It allows users to upload photos, organize them into albums, view pictures, navigate through them, and even have a slideshow experience using a carousel. Users also have the ability to delete photos by clicking on a delete button. The application utilizes the `react-photo-album` library for creating albums and managing photos and the `multer` npm package to handle photo uploads.
